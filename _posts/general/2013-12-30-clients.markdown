Each client is defined by id, name, code_name, secret 

*code_name* is used internally to fetch data from the right service

*secret* is used to sign the request url, making sure the requests are coming from valid clients

*Example*
{% highlight json %}
{
	id: 1,
	name: "Alcohol Delivery",
	code_name: "dyonisus",
	secret: "ASDJFdsfljsld349334-dsa3947"
}
{% endhighlight %}
