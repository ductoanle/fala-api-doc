Compulsory header & query parameters for every API request

* client_id (param)- Each client is identified by an id number
* timestamp (header) - Time that the request is made. Stale timestamp will be returned if the timestamp is off for more than 5 mintues
* key (header) - Hash that generated from the request url, client_id, timestamp and secret (Each client will be given a secret). "Invalid key" error returned in case the key does not match with the request
* no_cache (param | optional) - if value set to true, instead of returning cached result, the server will pull and return the latest data
* page, per_page (param | optional) - options to paginate result for faster response
* dev (param | optional) - if value set to true, will not check for timestamp and key (simpler to test out the API)
